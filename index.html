			<h2>Landing Page</h2>
      <h3 id="problemstatement">Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>Users that go on Mostly Mad Music should be able to quickly and easily be able to identify what the charity does as well as having a clear call to action. As the current website stands, they do a good job at giving information about what they do, however the website’s call to action can be a little confusing, pulling users into different directions; whether it be donating, joining or getting in touch about sourcing high end musicians. As a consequence of this, users browsing the site may not feel particularly inclined to follow any of the call to actions. I propose redesigning the website in such a way that focuses on a single and clear call to action; that being joining a strong and supportive online community that fosters the relationship between mental health and music either through playing or listening to others.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Background Research</h3>
			<p>Within the 21st century, there has been a shift in society’s views towards mental health and mental illness. This could be due to the growing prevalence of teens experiencing certain types of mental health; “more U.S. adolescents and young adults in the late 2010s, versus the mid-2000s, experienced serious psychological distress” (American Psychological Association, 2019). Further research undertaken by the American Psychological Association suggest that changes in cultural trends such as an “increased use of electronic communication and digital media” has had a big enough impact on modes of social interaction to warrant an increase in mood disorders.</p>
      <p>Mostly Mad Music is a small-scale charity established in 2017 that aims to “highlight the wonderfully therapeutic effects of music on mental health and well-being” (Mostly Mad Music, 2020). The charity have programs that focus on playing and listening to music as a sort of icebreaker to forge connections and open up with uncomfortable or hard conversations. Research has shown that music has potential positive effects for our mental health such as reducing stress, anxiety and depression with  “a recent study by Dr. David Lewis-Hodgson of Mindlab International… showing instrumental, classical or ambient music can help reduce anxiety by up to 65%” (Open Minds, 2020)</p>
      <h3 id="ethnography">Online Ethnography</h3>
      <p>Online ethnography was used as a “qualitative method for collecting data about a target audience” (Tomitsch, 2018). Online ethnography in this case was used to gather research on why/how people donate to charities. Data was collected from multiple reddit forums and observations were recorded, which was then subsequently summarised into main themes.</p>
      <blockquote>
				“I think this is a great idea to focus on one charity and use a more informed approach outside of just "metrics" and that makes logical sense to me… it might be better to focus on one right now and try to be as involved as you can. Even give feedback, I bet a charity would LOVE to hear from the people they could potentially have donating.” – Reddit user CrasyMike
			</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
				“…but things like a local bunnings BBQ, for example, are fun for everyone involved and people purchasing a sausage and cold drink are getting something back… instead of saying yes and giving everyone monetary donations, I prefer to get involved” – Anonymous 
			</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “I use charity navigator to make sure my giving is most effective. I like transparent charities that actually use donated money in what I believe to be an appropriate way. I also volunteer and donate items to thrift stores that support causes I like.” – Reddit user tropicalpuffin
      </blockquote>
      <p>The main themes that can be extracted after observations were recorded are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Informed about the charity</li>
        <li>Fun involvement</li>
        <li>Attachment and/or interest to charity</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="interviews">Unstructured User Interviews</h3>
      <p>Unstructured user interviews were used during the research phase of the design process in order to “gauge users’ opinions about concepts” as well as “develop empathy with the people we are designing for” (Tomitsch, 2018). These interviews were conducted with three participants over Discord and were conversational in nature; and were based around their experiences with participation with charities.</p>
      <blockquote>
				“I would only feel comfortable donating to a charity if I had sufficient background knowledge on them” – Aiden Abignano
			</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
				“Yeah I’d consider volunteering for a charity if their work involves helping people struggle, kind of like the struggle I saw when I lived in Papua New Guinea” – Euan Mendoza
			</blockquote>
      <p>From these interviews, similar ideas and themes were found to those found through online ethnography, that being:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well informed about the charity</li>
        <li>Attachment to the cause at hand</li>
      </ul>
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>User profiles were used to “present key attributes of different identified users” (Tomitsch, 2018). In this case, two types of users were identified: musicians and volunteers.</p>

      <h3 id="websitegoals">Website Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Informs users of what the organisation does and what they aim to achieve so that users know</li>
        <li>Clear, single call to action that invites users on the site to become part of an online community</li>
        <li>Fun and modern design of website – appeals to target audience, that being teenagers and young adults</li>
      </ul>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Moodboards were used to “visually represent design ideas, concept and values” (Tomitsch, 2018) as a way to encourage idea generation for the website.</p>
      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="images/moodboard.PNG" alt="Picture of moodboard" width="100%">
      <h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
      <p>Below contains the sitemap for the proposed changes to the website. Although simple, it categorises each content into its own page, something that the original website does not do. Users do not want to be overwhelmed on the landing page and splitting up the content on different webpages may alleviate some of this.</p>
      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="images/Sitemap.PNG" alt="Picture of sitemap" width="100%">
      <p>The next map expands a bit further on the basic sitemap to visually show the logical hierarchy of content on each webpage</p>
      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="images/Sitemapextended.PNG" alt="Picture of extended sitemap" width="100%">
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Sketching was a tool used to visually represent the page layout. Over the multiple iterations of sketching, they were effective in quickly homing in on how the final layout would look like, as well as allowing for more creative and practical solutions to designing the website.</p>
      <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
      <p>The first iteration sketches brought up interesting insights about incorporating the carousel. The idea was to use the carousel as a way to keep the majority of the design “above the fold” – this is something that the original website does not consider to a great extent. However, when researching further the practicality of using the carousel, it’s important to consider how they work on mobile phones.</p>
      <blockquote>
				“A hurried mobile user looking for specific content may never notice a carousel. Even when the carousel is self-animated, a mobile page is so small that by the time the carousel image has changed, the user may have scrolled down and not see it anymore.” (Budiu, 2018)
			</blockquote>
      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="images/Desktop1Sketches.png" alt="Picture of desktop sketches" width="100%">
      <figure class="img-container">
				<img src="images/Phone1Sketch.png" alt="Picture of desktop sketches" width="100%">
      <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
      <p>The second iteration of sketches saw the scrapping of the carousel idea due to the research from the second iteration. Instead, the sketches took a more grid like layout, with information being sectioned off into different boxes. As a result of this, this made it a little easier to design for mobile designs – one that has more verticality to it, to allow for a more comfortable viewing experience.</p>
